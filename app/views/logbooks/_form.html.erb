			They are crucial for your development because it is difficult to change a behavior if you don't challenge the belief that is triggering it.

			Start by diving in deep. The following tables provide item-level information on how you have evaluated yourself and how others see you. By analyzing these, you will get on very specific insights into the kinds of behaviors that are giving you a certain score. <br>
			For some, there may be a big difference between your self-evaluation and other’s evaluations, or there may be particularly high or low scores. These are very relevant behaviors to list. The exercise will give you a very specific picture of how your behavior could or should develop. You can also list behaviors where you have received a surprising or confusing evaluation from others.

			The second way (and this is made possible with the list you just created) is to arrange a conversation (or a few) with your leader, coach, someone else you trust. Use this meeting to discuss your report and your thoughts about it.

			Using the list of behaviors above is helpful because it gives you a very concrete anchor point that you can use when reflecting or inviting feedback during your discussion. In our experience, this often leads to very rich conversations.

			Actions

			If you feel it could be helpful, write down some actions. You can make them very specific and concrete using prompts such as ‘what’, ‘when’, ‘by when’, ‘how’ and ‘with whom’.<br>
			Alternatively, if it works better for you, keep them more general. Make a drawing, put in a picture, or something else that you find useful.
