    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">As I describe in my book, Mind Growing: Leadership is interaction. To grow your own mind and those of others so that you can become a great leader, interaction is key!</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">And while the saying goes “it takes two to tango”, this is only partly true. The dance analogy is super relevant, though, because you can start and influence the dance with your behavior! If you're dancing with someone and not making the right moves, the fun dies. People will get irritated, and at some point, you’ll lose your dancing partner. However, if you are willing to look at the way you’re dancing, to reflect upon it, learn some new passes, and practice…then dancing becomes more and more fun. You’ll have all the dancing partners you want. And of course, the dance itself becomes easier, more fun, and beautiful to watch if all dancing partners put in the same effort.</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">So interaction is a dance! You can make it a success or a failure.</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">The 360 Leadership Compass Behaviors is based on the famous concept of Timothy Leary, Leary’s Rose. During my 30 years of experience, I’ve developed my own approach to presenting and using it.</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">In Chapters Ten and Eleven of my book, Mind Growing: Leadership To Build Thriving Companies Through Personal Development, you can find an in-depth description of the tool as well as practical examples and tips that will help you apply it.</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">The 360° feedback tool collects feedback about how you are dancing at this moment, and what could help you become a star dancer!</p>

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">It will give you feedback and insight into the following elements:</p>


    <p class="font-paragraph-2 font-weight-bold">
      The 2 Core Dimensions:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">Active-Passive:</span> How active/dominant are you during interactions?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">I-WE:</span> Are you mainly defending your own interests and beliefs or showing your interest in a win-win outcome?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3 font-weight-bold">
      These 2 dimensions combined encompass 4 main colors and 8 behavioral strategies that shape an interaction:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-yyellow font-weight-bold">Yellow or initiating behavior (Active-We)</span>

      Your mindset is how you see the world; it encompasses your key beliefs about how humans and organizations should function. They steer the behavior that is covered in this report!
      <br>
      To clarify further, we have defined two opposite mindsets. Both are useful and necessary in certain circumstances.
      <br/>
      The two opposite mindsets are:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 font-paragraph-2">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">The Closed, Controlling Mindset.</span> If you have a closed/controlling mindset, you believe things need to be structured, organized and controlled. You believe people should focus on their tasks, receive clear instructions, and that you should follow through on them.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 font-paragraph-2">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">The Open, Exploring Mindset.</span>  If you have an open/exploring mindset, you believe you need to trust in people and processes. You believe giving people autonomy will create energy that can then be guided in the right direction.
