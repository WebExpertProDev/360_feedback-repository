    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">As described in my book Mind Growing: Leadership is interaction. To grow your own mind and those of others, interaction is key!</p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 font-weight-bold">
      Each interaction has a core DNA of 3 essential elements, namely:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">Content</span> leading to a result in a certain area. What is the content of the interaction? What are you talking about? And what needs to be the outcome or result?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">Structure</span> leading to a result. How is an interaction structured? What is the agenda? Wow will decisions be made, who takes which role, and so forth?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">Relations</span> leading to a result. How is the relationship between the people interacting? Do they respect each other? Is there trust? Are they listening to each other, taking care, of one another, and so forth?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3 font-weight-bold">
      These 3 elements play a role regardless of what level the interaction is taking place at:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-purple font-weight-bold">At an individual level:</span> What is your goal? How do you structure yourself? And how is your relationship with yourself? Do you respect, trust, and take care of yourself?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-purple font-weight-bold">At the level of a face-to-face talk:</span> What is the goal of the talk, the agenda? And how are you relating to your sparring partner?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      <span class="text-purple font-weight-bold">At the team level:</span> What are the team’s goals? How are meetings and roles structured? How are the relationships between team members?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      <span class="text-purple font-weight-bold">At the company level:</span> What is the company’s mission, structure, and culture?
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      Using our experience, and by looking at the challenges that face leaders and companies over the coming decades, we have defined the New Leadership ABCs - Ambition, Boundaries, Culture & Coaching. In essence these are 3 different words for the same DNA essential elements we called content, structure and relations.
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1 text-sky font-weight-bold">Ambition (content)</p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1 text-sky font-weight-bold">Boundaries (structure)</p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4 text-sky font-weight-bold">Culture and Coaching (relations)</p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      They are explained in further detail in my book:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-1">
      Mind Growing Leadership: Build thriving companies through personal growth
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      See also the books website: <a href="https://www.mindgrowing.net" target="_blank" class="text-sky">www.mindgrowing.net</a>
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      Then, in the context of future leadership, we defined how these different elements relate to one other and the leader as a person.
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      This led us to identify 7 key leadership challenges for the coming decades, and these are subject to the 360° compass leadership challenges. So, in essence, this questionnaire gathers feedback about key behaviors that relate to how you are dealing at this moment with these challenges and where to improve.
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-3 font-weight-bold">
      The 7 key leadership challenges are:

      These 7 leadership challenges are subject to the 360° Mind Growing Leadership compass challenges. We see them as a framework for collecting feedback from relevant others, so that leaders can better develop themselves to tackle current and future challenges.

    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-0 text-purple font-weight-bold">Mindset</p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      As explained in my book Mind Growing, your beliefs steer your behavior. This is why the questionnaire asks you to evaluate which beliefs you see as steering your leadership behavior. The collection of your beliefs is called Mindset.
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      To break things down further, we have defined two opposing mindsets:
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-4">
      A Closed/Controlling mindset;
      <br> An Open/Exploring mindset
    </p>
    <p class="font-paragraph-2 mb-2">
      Your own will be somewhere between these 2 opposites.

      Your mindset is how you see the world, and encompasses your key beliefs about how humans and organizations (need to) function.
      <br>
      To further clarify, we have defined two opposite mindsets. Both are useful and necessary in certain circumstances. The two opposite mindsets are:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 font-paragraph-2">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">The closed, controlling mindset.</span> If you have a closed/controlling mindset, you believe that things need to be structured, organized, and controlled. You believe that people should focus on their tasks. get clear instructions and that you should follow through on them
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 font-paragraph-2">
      <span class="text-sky font-weight-bold">The open, exploring mindset.</span> If you have an open/exploring mindset, you believe that you need to trust people and process. You believe that giving people autonomy will create energy that can be guided in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 font-paragraph-2">
      In the graph below, you can see where different categories of evaluators place you between the closed/controlling and open/exploring extremes. So your own mindset lies somewhere in between them! In the next section, you can see your scores on the different beliefs that are related to a closed or open mindset.
